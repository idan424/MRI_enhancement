MRI Enhancement Project - Python for Neuroscience Course
==============================


What Is This?
-------------

This is a sample Python application intended to provide a simple interface for MRI image enhancement. The goal is to have an image enhancement UI interface with adjustable parameters, which pre-processes images and applies a CLAHE algorithem.

Dependencies
---------------
1. Python 3.8
2. numpy  
3. matplotlib 3.5.2
4. tkinter
5. pytest 7.1.2
6. skimage
7. cv2
8. Pillow 9.2.0


How To Use This
---------------

1. Download all files
2. Check for and install relevant dependencies
3. (Optional) Replace images in the `images` folder with your own images
4. Run `main.py` , or `python3 "./src/main.py"`


Testing
-------

1. Install the dependencies
2. Run the relevant test in the `tests` folder
