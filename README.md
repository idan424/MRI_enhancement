MRI Enhancement Project - Python for Neuroscience Course
==============================


What Is This?
-------------

This is a sample Python application intended to provide a simple interface for MRI image enhancement. The goal is to have an image enhancement UI interface with adjustable parameters, which pre-processes images and applies a CLAHE algorithem.

Dependencies
---------------
Before you continue, ensure you have met the following system requirements and packages:

1. Python 3.8 
2. numpy  
3. matplotlib 3.5.2
4. tkinter
5. pytest 7.1.2
6. skimage
7. cv2
8. Pillow 9.2.0

(More recent updates are not guaranteed to work)

For the full list of requirements, see the `requirements.txt` file



How To Use This
---------------

1. Download all files
2. Check for and install relevant dependencies
3. (Optional) Replace images in the `images` folder with your own images
4. Run `main.py` , or `python3 "./src/main.py"`
    _ (Optional) Input your desired clipping threshold, and grid size
    _ Choose your image file(s)
    _ Repeat as needed


Testing
-------

1. Install the dependencies
2. Run the relevant test in the `tests` folder
