MRI Enhancement Project - Python for Neuroscience Course
==============================


What Is This?
-------------

This is a sample Python application intended to provide a simple interface for MRI image enhancement. The goal is to have an image enhancement UI interface with adjustable parameters, which pre-processes images and applies a CLAHE algorithem.

Dependencies
---------------
Before you continue, ensure you have met the following system requirements and packages:

1. Python 3.8 
2. NumPy
3. matplotlib
6. scikit-image
7. cv2
8. Pillow

(More recent updates are not guaranteed to work)

For the full list of requirements, see the `requirements.txt` file



How To Use This
---------------

1. Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/idan424/MRI_enhancement`
2. Check for and install relevant dependencies `install`.
3. (Optional) Replace images in the `images` folder with your own images
4. Run `main.py` , or `python3 "main.py"` in a console

- (Optional) Input your desired clipping threshold, and grid size
- Choose your image file(s)
- Saving with a checkbox


Testing
-------

1. Install the dependencies
2. Run the relevant test in the `tests` folder
